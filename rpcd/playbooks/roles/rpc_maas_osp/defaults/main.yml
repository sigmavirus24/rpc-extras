## MaaS Options
#
# maas_auth_method: Specifies how to authenticate against Rackspace Cloud Monitoring.
#
#   This can be set to one of the following two options:
#     - password: authorization uses the variables set in maas_auth_url, maas_api_key and
#                 maas_username
#     - token: authorization uses the maas_api_url and maas_auth_token key
#
maas_auth_method: password

#
# maas_auth_url: Rackspace Cloud auth URL.
#
maas_auth_url: https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0

#
# maas_tenant_id:  Rackspace Cloud tenant ID (required when maas_auth_method is set to password).
#
maas_tenant_id: SomeTenantID

#
# maas_username: Rackspace Cloud user name (required when maas_auth_method is set to password).
#
maas_username: SomeUserName

#
# maas_username: Rackspace Cloud API key (required when maas_auth_method is set to password).
#
maas_api_key: SomeAPIKey

#
# maas_auth_token: Rackspace Cloud auth token (required when maas_auth_method is set to token).
#
maas_auth_token: some_token

#
# maas_api_url: Cloud Monitoring endpoint (required when maas_auth_method is set to token).
#
maas_api_url: https://monitoring.api.rackspacecloud.com/v1.0/{{ maas_tenant_id }}

#
# maas_notification_plan: The Cloud Monitoring notification plan, which defines who will be
#                         notified, and for what.
#
maas_notification_plan: npManaged

#
# maas_external_ip_address:
#
maas_external_ip_address: "{{ external_vip_address }}"

#
# maas_agent_token: The Cloud Monitoring agent token to configure the agent with.
#
#   By default an agent token is created for each entity. However, you may prefer to use the same
#   agent token for all entities. In that case, specify the agent token here.
#
#maas_agent_token: some_token

#
# maas_target_alias: An alias used for remote checks in the event that a device has multiple
#                    public IP addresses or if there are other issues with the default primary IP
#                    address.
#
#   For remote checks, the entity specified by lb_name in rpc_user_config has a variable that
#   denotes the IP addresses to check against. By default, this is the public0_v4 address. Setting
#   this variable enables checks to be performed against public1_v4 or any other variable that is
#   in the entity for the correct IP.
#
maas_target_alias: public0_v4

#
# ssl_check: This flag indicates if the ssl-related checks and alarms should be deployed.
#
ssl_check: true

#
# dell_check: This flag indicates if the Dell-related hardware monitoring checks and alarms should
#             be deployed.
#
dell_check: false

#
# remote_check: This flag indicates if the remote.http checks and alarms should be deployed.
#
remote_check: true
hp_check: false

#
# lb_name: Defines the entity name of the load balancing device against which the remote MaaS
#          checks and alarms are configured.
#
lb_name: 'unspecified'

#
# maas_scheme: The scheme (http/https) to use when creating remote.http checks.
#
maas_scheme: http

#
# maas_*_scheme: Override the scheme (http/https) for an indivual service.
#
# maas_cinder_scheme: https
# maas_glance_scheme: https
# maas_keystone_scheme: https
# maas_neutron_scheme: https
# maas_nova_scheme: https
maas_horizon_scheme: https
# maas_heat_api_scheme: https
# maas_heat_cfn_scheme: https
# maas_heat_cloudwatch_scheme: https
# maas_swift_proxy_scheme: https

#
# maas_keystone_user: The keystone user to use/create to allow monitoring plugins to query
#                     OpenStack APIs.
#
maas_keystone_user: maas

#
# maas_rabbitmq_user: The rabbitmq user that is created for rabbitmq tests to use.
#
#
maas_rabbitmq_user: maas_user

#
# maas_alarm_local_consecutive_count: The number of consecutive failures before an alert is
#                                     generated for local checks.
#
#   WARNING: Changing this variable affects a customer's SLA, DO NOT change unless you are sure you
#            are sure you know what you're doing!
#
maas_alarm_local_consecutive_count: 3

#
# maas_alarm_remote_consecutive_count: The number of consecutive failures before an alert is
#                                      generate for remote checks.
#
#   WARNING: Changing this variable affects a customer's SLA, DO NOT change unless you are sure you
#            are sure you know what you're doing!
#
maas_alarm_remote_consecutive_count: 1

#
# maas_check_period: The polling interval, defined in seconds
#
#   WARNING: Changing this variable affects a customer's SLA, DO NOT change unless you are sure you
#            are sure you know what you're doing!
#
maas_check_period: 60

#
# maas_check_timeout: Time that will elapse before timeout, defined in seconds. This period must be
#                     less than the maas_check_period.
#
#   WARNING: Changing this variable affects a customer's SLA, DO NOT change unless you are sure you
#            are sure you know what you're doing!
#
maas_check_timeout: 30

#
# maas_monitoring_zones: Specifies the list of data centers (DCs) to poll from for remote
#                        (non-agent) checks.
#
# The default is usually sufficient; for example, if three out of five zones return without failure,
# the check will complete successfully. If for some reason one DC consistently could not perform
# the checks, or if you want to explicitly exclude a DC, set this variable to a list of zones that
# does not include the blocked DC.
#
maas_monitoring_zones:
  - mzdfw
  - mziad
  - mzord
  - mzlon
  - mzhkg

#
# maas_fqdn_extension: Sets the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) extension that will be appended
#                      to the short names for hosts that are specified in rpc_user_config. This
#                      avoids the need to specify extremely long container names.
#
#   For example, if this variable was not set, a device called 12345-node1.mytestcluster.com would
#   have to be named in openstack_user_config.yml as 12345-node1.mytestcluster.com for MaaS checks
#   to be created correctly. However, if maas_fqdn_extension is set as .mytestcluster.com, the
#   device can be named 12345-node1 in openstack_user_config.yml. This enables shorter container
#   names while still enabling MaaS checks and alarms to be created properly.
#
# maas_fqdn_extension: .example.com
maas_fqdn_extension:

#
# maas_excluded_devices: Specifies devices that will be skipped when creating alarms for disk
#                        utilisation monitoring.
#
# maas_excluded_devices: ['xvde']

#
# maas_filesystem_threshold: Sets the threshold (%) for filesystem monitoring when you are not
#                            specifying specific filesystems.
#
maas_filesystem_warning_threshold: 80.0
maas_filesystem_critical_threshold: 90.0

#
# maas_filesystem_monitors: Explicitly set the filesystems to set up monitors/alerts for.
#
#   NOTE: You can override these in your openstack_user_config.yml per device using
#         "maas_filesystem_overrides".
#
# maas_filesystem_monitors:
#  - filesystem: /
#    warning_threshold: 80.0
#    critical_threshold: 90.0
#  - filesystem: /boot
#    warning_threshold: 80.0
#    critical_threshold: 90.0
